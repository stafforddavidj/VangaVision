# VangaVision

VangaVision outputs the coordinates of celestial bodies as viewed from a given geolocation and time.
This is accomplished by calculating the location of the sun, moon, etc. using known constants and mathematical models of their position in relation to the earth.
The algorithms are based on the equations in the book [Celestial Calculations](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/celestial-calculations) and implemented in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) programming language.

**Note:** This is still very incomplete. most of the solar system needs to be implemented still!
